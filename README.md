# Machine Learning Classification of 2020 Presidential Election Outcomes

This project was for my STATS 101C - Statistical Modeling and Data Mining course.

I spent many hours immersed in fine-tuning models and had more fun than I expected to. In a team of five, we were given a large data set of 3,111 rows and asked to employ the course material we practiced to build a full modeling pipeline in RStudio, from data cleaning and preprocessing to predicting and obtaining results.

The files included are:
main_code.rmd - The primary R Markdown file I worked with to build and test models.
best_model_code.rmd - Isolated code for the best model I built.
report.pdf - The written team report.
train_class.csv, test_class.csv, and col_descriptions.csv - The training set, testing set, and variable descriptions.
